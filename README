This is a WIP Twitch.tv viewer for Android.

Current issues:

Multiple WebViews or multiple videos in a single WebView are spawned, causing slowdown/repeating audio
WebViews are not destroyed when navigated away from, which causes the audio to keep playing and slowdown
No loading spinners, looks like application is unresponsive when you select someting

Features that need adding:

Loading animations
Favorites
